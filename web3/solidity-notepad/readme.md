## This is my webui demo of using solidity & ether.js as a text editor.

To use this:
1. Compile and deploy the Solidity contract to an Ethereum testnet (e.g., Ropsten or Hardhat) using Remix
2. Replace YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS with the deployed contract address
3. Open the HTML file in a web browser with MetaMask installed and connected to the same network where the contract is deployed.
