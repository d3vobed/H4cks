## Using bambdas with burp
- simple as anything just copy the java code and slam it on your history or project filter on burp and you can also add multiple ParamGroups by just setting the highlightGroup to filter for multiple colors and responses
- next just tweak the yaml to what you're searching for 
- run the bash like a skid and you're all set

Don't run the bambda file using another java compiler you'll run through compilation hell due to dumb portswigger montoya api
