## Quick Setup
Use this to guide:
1. git clone $URL or download as zip
2. cd flash-web3/
3. ``npm install`` 
4. Upload to the extensions page on chrome/firefox
-> Firefox: To test our extension we have to open the Firefox Debugging tool. We do that by typing ``about:debugging`` in the Firefox URL bar. Next, we click on the This Firefox tab which provides information about the extensions and running workers. Our focus will be on the top of the page, more specifically on the Temporary Extensions panel.

Click on Load Temporary Add-onâ€¦ which should open a file picker. Navigate to the build folder of the extension, select the index.html and press Open.

-> Chrome/Brave: Settings -> Extensions -> Load Extensions -> Select the dist folder -> Voila :)
